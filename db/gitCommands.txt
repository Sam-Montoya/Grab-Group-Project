! GIT IS CASE SENSITIVE

I WANT to make a change to the [name] branch

- git checkout [name]

I MADE a change in the [name] branch, and want to push it to the [name] staging branch (ex: Backend, Frontend)
(Do this once you are sure your code works properly, and want to communicate with endpoints, etc)

* Make sure you're inside the [name] branch via git checkout [name]

- git commit -m 'message'
- git push
- git checkout Backend / Frontend
- git merge origin/[name] ( Database or Server )
